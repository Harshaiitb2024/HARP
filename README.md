# HARP HOA Dataset
HARP: A Large-Scale Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset

Accepted at ICASSP GenDA 2025 workshop.

Provided code for generating HOA RIRs using ISM. 
This is first version of HARP that uses SphericalHarmonicDirectivity class to generate 7th order HOA.
The details can be found in the paper.

If requirements are met, just run Generate.py to generate RIRs. Setting parameters num_rooms and num_positions allows you to change the number of rooms and positions in each room to be generated.

An update is already in progress which generates higher quality of HOA RIRs using Ray Tracing method.

Citation will be provided soon.
